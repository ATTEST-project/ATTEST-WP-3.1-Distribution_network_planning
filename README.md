# Python Energy Systems Simulator (PyEnSyS) for FutureDAMS

This repository contains the `PyEnSyS` model for testing energy systems within
the context of FutureDAMS. It combines an energy balancing engine and
a steady-state electricity networks simulation engine for estimating 
energy use while considering losses and network limits. 


## Getting started

### Dependencies

Running this code will require,

- pyomo
- pypsa (optional)
- glpk

### Recommended package management and environment management systems

For most users it will be easier to install the binary packages made available 
for the Anaconda Python distribution. The use of Anaconda is recommended for
the automatic installation of pyene and all its cython related dependencies.

### Installing

Use the command below to install pyensys in your device.
```bash
pip install pyensys
```

### Running

Examples on how to run pyenesys can be found clicking in the icon for Google Colaboratory below.
